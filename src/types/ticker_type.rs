/// #### What Is A Ticker?
/// In short, a ticker is a type used to track the time between events.
///
/// In long, a ticker is a self-contained counter that advances a value (current_value) between two boundaries
/// (start_value and end_value) at a fixed rate, driven by however much time passes between
/// calls to .tick(). Depending on its behavior, a Ticker can loop back to start_value when
/// it reaches a boundary, stop at the boundary it hits, or become locked in place once it
/// reaches end_value.
///
/// "Time" here is intentionally generic — .tick() doesn't assume seconds, frames, or any
/// specific unit. It just compares whatever delta you feed .tick() against time_interval and
/// advances current_value accordingly, which is what lets the same ticker logic drive a
/// frame-timed cooldown, a world clock, or anything else that changes over some unit of "time".
///
/// A ticker's unit of time will be equal to the unit of the number you pass into the ticker's .tick() call(s).
///
/// ---
///
/// #### What Are The Fields of a Ticker And What Do They Do?
///
/// - **`start_value`**
///     - Represents the beginning value of a ticker and acts as one of the boundaries for current_value.
///     - Can be manipulated through addition and setter methods if the ticker is mutable.
///
/// - **`current_value`**
///     - Represents the value a ticker is currently at.
///     - current_value is bound to the range that start_value and end_value create.
///     - Ticking causes current_value to change, even if the ticker is immutable.
///     - Can be manipulated through addition and setter methods if the ticker is mutable.
///     - **For Looping Tickers**
///         - current_value will be set to start_value when a loop triggers.
///         - current_value hitting end_value will cause a loop to trigger.
///     - **For Oneshot Tickers**
///         - current_value hitting a boundary will assign current_value to be the boundary's value.
///     - **For Freezing Tickers**
///         - current_value hitting end_value will cause the ticker to become immutable.
///
/// - **`end_value`**
///     - Represents the ending value of a ticker and acts as one of the boundaries for current_value.
///     - Can be manipulated through addition and setter methods if the ticker is mutable.
///
/// - **`time_interval`**
///     - The amount of time that it takes for current_value to change by 1.
///     - Use this field to slow or speed up current_value's change.
///     - Can be manipulated through addition and setter methods if the ticker is mutable.
///
/// - **`stored_time`**
///     - Represents the remainder of time from the last .tick() call.
///     - Used by the .tick() method to keep the timing accurate.
///
/// - **`is_paused`**
///     - Represents whether a ticker is paused or not. A paused ticker prevents .tick() calls from doing anything.
///     - Can be manipulated through a setter method if the ticker is mutable.
///
/// - **`is_ticking_up`**
///     - Represents the tick direction of a ticker.
///     - Ticking up means that current_value will increase by 1 when the value of time stored in time_interval passes.
///     - Ticking down means that current_value will decrease by 1 when the value of time stored in time_interval passes.
///     - Can be manipulated through a setter method if the ticker is mutable.
///
/// - **`is_handling_time_spikes`**
///     - **If True**
///         - Will make it so that .tick() calls on a ticker are to add or subtract all built-up integer time since
///         the last .tick() call to current_value; addition/subtraction is dependent on is_ticking_up.
///         Any floating remainder gets put into stored_time for the next .tick() call.
///     - **If False**
///         - Will make it so that .tick() calls on a ticker are to add or subtract 1 to current_value;
///         addition/subtraction is dependent on is_ticking_up.
///     - Can be manipulated through a setter method if the ticker is mutable.
///
/// - **`behavior`**
///     - Dictates the type of behavior a ticker is currently set to.
///     - Can be used to stop a ticker from looping, or to start a ticker to loop.
///     - Can be used to change the mutability of a ticker.
///     - Can be manipulated through a setter method if the ticker is mutable **or** immutable.
///
/// ---
///
/// #### What Are the Different Behaviors a Ticker Can Have?
///
/// - **`Looper`**
///     - The ticker is **immutable** and will loop when current_value hits either start_value or end_value.  When a loop triggers, current_value is reset back to start_value.
///
///
/// - **`MutLooper`**
///     - The ticker is **mutable** and will loop when current_value hits either start_value or end_value.  When a loop triggers, current_value is reset back to start_value.
///
///
/// - **`Oneshot`**
///     - The ticker is **immutable** and will assign current_value to a boundary's value if current_value were to hit start_value or end_value; start and end values are the boundaries.
///     - The ticker's stored_time is set to 0.0 when current_value hits end_value.  This ensures the time state is completely reset once it reaches the end.

///     - The ticker's stored_time is set to 0.0 when current_value hits end_value.  This ensures the time state is completely reset once it reaches the end.
///
///
/// - **`Freezing`**

///     - The ticker's stored_time is set to 0.0 when current_value hits end_value.  This ensures the time state is completely reset once it reaches the end.
///
/// ---
///
/// #### What Exactly is Changeable in Tickers?
/// - **`Ticker is Mutable`**
///     - Every field besides stored_time can be manipulated directly.  stored_time can be changed indirectly through the .hard_reset() method.
/// - **`Ticker is Immutable`**
///     - The only field that can be changed is behavior; this does mean that you can flip immutable tickers to mutable ones.
/// - **`Ticker is Mutable or Immutable`**
///     - current_value and stored_time will be changed if a ticker is ticking.  How and when these fields change is based on the ticker's boolean fields, what behavior the ticker is set to, and when .tick() gets called.
///
/// ---
///
/// #### What Are the Different Ticker Datatypes?
/// - **`Ticker<i8, f16>`** : 59+ Bits
/// - **`Ticker<i16, f16>`** : 83+ Bits
/// - **`Ticker<i32, f16>`** : 131+ Bits

/// - **`Ticker<i16, f64>`** : 179+ Bits
/// - **`Ticker<i32, f64>`** : 227+ Bits
///
/// The "+" in the bit count is to recognize that the behavior field holds an enum value, and I have no idea
/// how many bits an enum declaration represents.
///
/// ---
///
/// #### How Do I Make A Ticker Tick?
/// Call the .tick() method on a ticker and pass in the time between 2 events, ticking is *usually* for events
/// that happen both consistently and constantly (such as when frames render); the .tick() method does have the

    // ########################### THE TICK (THE MOST IMPORTANT METHOD) ######################### //
    /// #### Description of .tick()
    /// Used to advance a ticker by taking in a passing of time between 2 events, *usually* for events
    /// that happen both consistently and constantly (such as when frames render); it does have the
    /// ability to take in **any** delta time.
    ///
    /// ---
    ///
    /// #### What The Hell Does Ticking Do?
    /// The simplified version (read the method's code for the complex version) of calling the .tick()
    /// method on a ticker is as follows:
    /// 1. Increase stored_time by the value passed to the .tick() call (elapsed_time_between_events).
    /// 2. If stored_time is greater than or equal to the time_interval, change current_value.
    /// 3. Reassign stored_time to the result of `stored_time %= time_interval`.  We do this to carry
    /// over our remainder to keep the state of a Ticker's time accurate to the events that are being
    /// tracked.
    ///
    /// ---
    ///
    /// #### What Impacts Ticking And How?
    /// The fields of a ticker which impact the calculations inside this method are as follows:
    /// - `is_paused`
    ///     - **True** : Prevent the tick method from doing anything.
    ///     - **False** : Tick method will determine if current_value needs to be changed.
    /// - `is_ticking_up`
    ///     - **True** : .tick() calls will increase current_value.
    ///     - **False** : .tick() calls will decrease current_value.
    /// - `is_handling_time_spikes`
    ///     - **True** : The full integer magnitude from the result of `elapsed_time + stored_time` will be used to change current_value.
    ///     - **False** : As long as stored_time is greater than or equal to the time_interval, current_value will change by 1.
    /// - `behavior`
    ///     - **Looper** : Reset current_value to start_value when a ticker boundary is hit; boundaries are start_value and end_value.
    ///     - **MutLooper** :  Reset current_value to start_value when a ticker boundary is hit; boundaries are start_value and end_value.
    ///     - **Oneshot** : current_value will be set to the boundary it hits or goes past.
    ///     - **MutOneshot** : current_value will be set to the boundary it hits or goes past.
    ///     - **Freezing** : current_value will be set to the boundary it hits or goes past.
    ///
    /// ---
    ///
    /// #### Does .tick() Impact a Ticker's Units?
    /// Yes.  The units for a Ticker's integers and float fields are based on what is passed into the
    /// .tick() method.  If the passed value represents the difference in seconds between 2 frames,
    /// the Ticker's time_interval and stored_time units would be seconds.  From there, the start_value,
    /// current_value, and end_value would be based on time_interval's value and unit.  For instance,
    /// if time_interval is set to 37.0 and .tick() took in seconds, then a 1 inside any of the value
    /// fields will be equal to 37 seconds; a 2 in current_value in this example would be 74 seconds.
    ///
    /// ---
    ///
    /// #### Example of .tick() in Action
    /// Consider the following factors first:
    /// - `The Horror You've Undergone` : You've seen 8 clowns between 2 blinks.  You decide to make a ticker to calculate this horror.
    /// - `Ticker's Starting time_interval Value` : 1.7
    /// - `Ticker's Starting stored_time Value` : 0.0
    /// - A .tick() call produced 4 for its magnitude_of_time_that_passed.
    /// - At the end of the .tick() call, stored_time is 0.705882353.
    /// - The ticker you're using to track all of this has is_handling_time_spikes set to true.
    ///
    /// Now, here's a step-by-step scenario involving our known factors:
    /// 1. You've undergone horror.
    /// 2. You throw in the 8 clowns to a .tick() call as it represents the time between your known events (blinks).
    /// 2. Your stored_time started at 0 and now adds up to 8 clowns seen.  Taking in these clowns has turned your Ticker's units to "clowns seen".
    ///     - The clowns seen is our time unit.  An equivalent to this would be seconds as a unit between frames being rendered.
    ///     - A blink is the event that tells us when to log things.  An equivalent to this would be a new frame being rendered.
    /// 3. Your time_interval is set to 1.7 clowns seen, which will mean that we only add 1 to current_value after we've seen 1.7 clowns.
    /// 4. Since is_handling_time_spikes is set to true, we take our 8 clowns and divide that by our time_interval of 1.7.  4.705882353 is the result.
    /// 5. .tick() will truncate 4.705882353 to 4 and the 0.705882353 will act as a remainder.
    /// 6. The remainder of 0.705882353 gets assigned to stored_time so that the next .tick() call can account for how many clowns were carried over from the last blink period.
    /// 7. The 4 is what gets added or subtracted from current_value depending on if is_ticking_up is set to true or false.
    /// 8. Voila. .tick() call is complete.
